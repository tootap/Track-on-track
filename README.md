# Track-on-track

This is our ECE 477 senior design project.

Track-on-Track is a project which helps users to find their belongings. It is placed with a user’s belonging and uses a GSM module to connect with a phone app which shows the location of the device. A smartphone application will be available to allow the user to interact with the device but it can also be interacted with through GSM.  When the device is in shorter range, it uses a bluetooth module and shows on the app whether the user is getting closer to the device. The user will be able to see the device’s location, activate a sound alarm on the device, and manipulate the devices settings remotely. The user will also be able to interact with the device’s settings through various buttons and an LCD on the device.
